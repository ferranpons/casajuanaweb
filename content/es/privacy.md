Last updated: June 1th, 2023

##License Agreement
This License Agreement (“Agreement”) is a legal agreement between appkickstarter and you, the end user (“Licensee”), for the appkickstarter product (“Software”). By installing, copying, or otherwise using the Software, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, the Software should be immediately removed from your devices and you should not use the Software in any way.

You may not redistribute or re-sell the source code.

##Grant of License
appkickstarter hereby grants to Licensee, and Licensee accepts, a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install, copy, use and modify the Software only as permitted in this Agreement. All product licenses are perpetual and royalty-free.

Licensee is granted one license to use the Software as the basis of up to three applications so long as those applications are owned and operated by Licensee or Licensee’s clients.

##Redistribution Rights
Licensee reasonably ensures that the Software is not distributed in any form that allows it to be reused by any application other than Licensee’s solution. Licensee must inform customers that they are not allowed to use the Software independently and that to redistribute the Software, they must obtain an appropriate license from appkickstarter.

Licensee may not redistribute the Software to anyone via any means other than to customers as part of a purchased, integrated solution that includes functionality beyond that provided solely by the Software.

##Refunds
Due to the non-returnable nature of the Software, refunds will not be provided under any circumstances. If issues arise with the Software, Licensee should contact appkickstarter support for assistance.

##Other Rights and Limitations
At no time may the Software be used for development purposes by individuals other than licensed developers. The Software may not be distributed for use with solutions or packaged products other than those developed by Licensee.

The Software may not be distributed as part of products that have the same or substantially the same primary functionality. Licensee is not allowed to resell, transfer, rent, lease, or sublicense the Software or associated rights. Licensee may not grant further redistribution rights to end-users of Licensee’s solution.

Licensee may use the appkickstarter product names, logos or trademarks to market Licensee’s own software. Licensee is not allowed to use, copy, modify, or merge copies of the Software except as permitted in this Agreement. Licensee agrees to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend appkickstarter from any claims or lawsuits related to Licensee’s software.
